### Semantic HTML

**Semantic HTML**: uses semantic grouping tags to offer meaning to distinct portions of the page. Some of the most widely used semantic grouping tags are:

  - `<article>`: Content that is self-contained and may be distributed separately.
  - `<section>`: Non-self-contained thematic grouping of material.
  - `<header>`: introductory material
  - `<main>`: Main content, just one per page.
  - `<nav>`:A section of links, generally used for the page's principal navigation.
  - `<aside>`: Non-essential stuff that is tangentially connected to the primary topic. Without this material, the page would make sense.
  - `<footer>`: The document's footer, which often contains copyright information.
