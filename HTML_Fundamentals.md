## HTML Basics 

**HTML**: The core language of the web, encompassing the information and structure of a website, is HyperText Markup Language. HTML is classified as a declarative language.

**Tag**: Tags are the most common way to mark up material in HTML. Tags make use of syntax `<tagname>content</tagname>`
  - HTML pages feature a basic layout that is organized in a tree-like structure.
  - `<html>` is used to construct an HTML 
  - `<title>` is a tag that appears at the top of the browser as the title
  - `<body>` includes the text shown on the browser
  - `<! Doctype>` is a declaration tag that informs the browser about the kind of content that is being read
  - `<html>` initiate an html document
  - `<header>` is a header element
  - `<body>` refers to the body of an html document

**Block-level Elements**: A Block-level element takes up the whole horizontal space of its parent element (container) as well as the vertical space equal to the height of its contents, resulting in the formation of a "block." Unlike other elements, a block-level element always begins on a new line and occupies the whole available width (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Block-level elements are only permitted to exist inside the `<body>` element. The following are some of the block-level elements, `<div>`, `<hr>`, `<li>` `<nav>`, `<p>`, `<table>` etc.

**Inline Elements**: Inline elements are those that just fill the space between their defining tags without interrupting the flow of the text. In other words, an inline element does not begin on a new line and occupies just the space required.
