### `<p>`

The paragraph tag is often used for blocks of text (but they may sometimes include other paragraph-related elements such as images). As an example: `<p> This is a paragraph</p>`.

### Heading Tags 

HTML tags are represented as `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The top level heading is `<h1>`, the secondary subheading is `<h2>`, and so on. As an example:
  `<h1>Primary Heading</h1>`
  `<h2> Secondary Heading</h2>`
